### **Complete and Extensive Overview of Technical Expertise and Project Documentation**

#### **_*BICEP, NANopt, and Algorhythm are currently being developed in private repositories. Development progress and/or source code available upon request. Details on implementation strategy is publicly available with extensive documentation._**

### Intent:

I am someone who thrives on taking complex ideas and shaping them into groundbreaking solutions, driven by a bold independence and an insatiable curiosity. An independent learner by nature, Iâ€™ve pursued every skill and project outside of the university curriculum, diving into fields like quantum computing, neural networks, and distributed systems purely out of fascination for their possibilities.

Originally, I began this journey simply to feed my curiosity. However, the rabbit hole I caught myself in has equipped me with the knowledge to redefine these fields in real-world applications. From architecting efficient AI solutions to designing frameworks like **BICEP**, I approach every project with the ambition to push boundaries, blending strong foundational knowledge with an unorthodox, disruptive perspective.

**_For me, innovation isnâ€™t just about new ideasâ€”itâ€™s about creating impactful, transformative results. Each project is a chance to make a meaningful difference, not only in my work but in the broader tech landscape._**
