Thank you for visiting my page. All projects listed were pursued for an interest none other
than my own. Though many topics here exist outside of my undergraduate university curriculum, I
am thankful for the free educational content that has greatly influenced the person I am today.

I'm driven by a bold intellectual curiosity and a determination to innovate beyond the ordinary.
At first, I developed an interest in understanding advanced concepts like quantum computing,
neural networks, and distributed systems like blockchain.

Now, I’m inspired to create and optimize them in ways that challenge conventional approaches.
From architecting efficient AI solutions to building frameworks like BICEP, I approach each project
with the ambition to push boundaries and make meaningful impact.

I thrive in tackling complex challenges, blending foundational knowledge with a fresh, disruptive
perspective that’s focused on real-world applications and transformative possibilities.
