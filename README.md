## **Credits:**

As stated, the projects listed here were pursued solely out of personal interest, with no obligation or external requirements. Much of what Iâ€™ve learned falls outside the scope of my undergraduate curriculum, and I am deeply grateful to the educational materials provided by leading academic institutions and industry giants, including:

**MIT, Harvard, IBM, Google, Microsoft, Stack Exchange, GitHub, Reddit,** and others.
