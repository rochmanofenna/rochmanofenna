### **Complete and Extensive Overview of Technical Expertise and Project Documentation**
Last Updated: Mid October 

#### **_*BICEP, NANopt, and ENNs are currently being developed in private repositories. Development progress and/or source code available upon request. Details on implementation strategy is publicly available with extensive documentation._**

</div>

### Intent:

I am someone who thrives on taking complex ideas and shaping them into groundbreaking solutions, driven by a bold independence and an insatiable curiosity. An independent learner by nature, I’ve pursued many skills and every project listed outside of the university curriculum, diving into niche topics such as: 

- **_quantum processing_**
- **_artificial neural networks_**
- **_blockchain design_**
- **_optimization techniques_**
- **_data augmentation_**

Originally, I began this journey simply to feed my curiosity. However, the rabbit hole I caught myself in has equipped me with the knowledge to redefine these fields in real-world applications. From architecting efficient AI solutions to designing frameworks like **BICEP**, I approach every project with the ambition to push boundaries, blending strong foundational knowledge with an unorthodox, disruptive perspective.

**_For me, innovation isn’t just about new ideas—it’s about creating impactful, transformative results. Each project is a chance to make a meaningful difference, not only in my work but in the broader tech landscape._**

## **Credits:**

As stated, the projects listed here were pursued solely out of personal interest, with no obligation or external requirements. Much of what I’ve learned falls outside the scope of my undergraduate curriculum, and I am deeply grateful to the educational materials provided by leading academic institutions and industry giants, including:

**MIT, Harvard, IBM, Google, Microsoft, Stack Exchange, GitHub, Reddit,** and others.
